# ü©∫ Stroke Feature Analysis  

## üìä Project Overview  
This project investigates the relationships between patient health metrics and the occurrence of **stroke** through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to uncover patterns and significant correlations that can inform predictive models and healthcare decisions.  

Key steps include:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.  
- Statistical analysis to identify meaningful relationships between features.  
- High-quality visualizations to effectively communicate insights.  

This project serves as a foundation for future **machine learning** applications in healthcare analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  
### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- **Missing Value Handling**: Strategies for imputing or removing missing data.  
- **Feature Encoding**: Conversion of categorical data using techniques like **Label Encoding** and **Ordinal Encoding**.  
- **Scaling**: Use of **MinMaxScaler** and **StandardScaler** for normalization of numerical features.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- **Univariate Analysis**: Histograms and boxplots for individual feature distributions.  
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Correlation heatmaps and scatterplots to identify relationships between features.  
- **Statistical Testing**: Chi-squared tests and hypothesis testing to confirm significant associations.  

### 3. Visualization  
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis.  
- Pair plots and scatterplots to visualize trends.  
- Customized plots with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for better clarity.
